## 1. General Rules and Laws in Turkish Territorial Waters

All maritime activities in Turkey are regulated by international and national legislation.

*   **International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs):** These globally applicable rules regulate the right of way between vessels, navigation lights, and sound and visual signals. Every mariner must know and apply these rules.
*   **Ports Law No. 6093 and Related Regulations:** Regulates navigation, anchoring, berthing, and other activities within port areas. It is mandatory to comply with the instructions of harbor masters.
*   **Environmental Law:** Polluting the seas is strictly prohibited. Discharging bilge, garbage, sewage, and other waste into the sea is subject to severe penalties. Waste must be delivered to waste reception facilities at marinas.

## 2. Mandatory Documents to be Kept on Every Vessel

The essential documents required on a Turkish-flagged private vessel are:

1.  **Certificate of Registry / Tonnage Certificate:** This is the vessel's identity document. It specifies the vessel's registration, dimensions, engine power, and owner. It must always be kept on board.
2.  **Amateur Seaman's Certificate (ADB) or Higher Competency Certificate:** Mandatory for operating vessels larger than 2.5 meters and smaller than 24 meters. It is the captain's license.
3.  **Short Range Certificate (SRC) Operator's Certificate:** If the vessel has a fixed or handheld VHF radio, the operator must possess this certificate.
4.  **Mandatory Vessel Insurance:** The policy for insurance covering third-party liability at sea.

## 3. Mandatory Safety and Navigation Equipment

The minimum required equipment varies depending on the vessel's length, but generally, every vessel should have:

*   **Life Safety:**
    *   **Life jackets** for each person on board (with special sizes for children).
    *   At least one **lifebuoy** (preferably with a light and a drogue).
    *   **Flares** (handheld flares, parachute flares, smoke signals).
    *   **First-aid kit**.
*   **Fire Safety:**
    *   **Fire extinguishers** of a suitable number and type for the vessel's size and structure.
*   **Navigation and Anchoring:**
    *   **Navigation lights** (starboard-port, masthead, stern).
    *   **Sound signaling device** (horn or bell).
    *   **Radar reflector**.
    *   **Magnetic compass**.
    *   **Anchor, chain, and rope** (appropriate for the vessel's size and weight).
    *   **Emergency tiller system**.
*   **Other:**
    *   **Holding tank** and waste discharge system.
    *   **Basic toolkit**.
    *   **Nautical charts** (for the area of navigation).

## 4. Use of Flags and Ensigns

*   **Turkish Flag:** Every Turkish-flagged vessel must fly a clean and undamaged **Turkish Flag** on the stern staff or in the most prominent position.
*   **Club Burgee:** The burgee of the yacht or marina club to which one belongs is typically flown from the starboard spreader of the main mast.

## 5. Rules for Transiting the Turkish Straits (Istanbul and Çanakkale)

The Turkish Straits are subject to strict international and national rules. The basic rules for private vessels are:

*   **Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS):** Small vessels must navigate **outside** the lanes designated for large ships, keeping to the right side according to their direction of travel.
*   **VHF Radio Watch:** The relevant **Sector Channel** (e.g., Sector Marmara, Sector Kandilli for Istanbul / Sector Nara, Sector Gelibolu for Çanakkale) must be monitored continuously throughout the transit. Vessel traffic announcements are made on these channels.
*   **Right of Way:** Ships proceeding within the traffic separation scheme have the right of way. Small vessels must keep clear of their path.
*   **Currents:** Currents are very strong, especially in the Bosphorus Strait. The passage plan should account for this.
*   **Reporting:** Vessels over a certain length may be required to report to Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) before and during transit.

## 6. TRAVELING TO GREECE (CROSS-BORDER PROTOCOLS)

Entering Greece by private vessel means entering the **European Union (Schengen Zone)**. This requires strict adherence to international border laws.

### 6.1. Documents Required for Entry
*   **Passports:** Valid for at least 3 months beyond the return date. **Schengen Visa** is mandatory for Turkish citizens (unless holding a Green Passport or eligible for Visa-on-Arrival programs).
*   **Vessel Registry:** Original document.
*   **Insurance:** Must explicitly state coverage for **"Greek Territorial Waters"** and meet minimum EU liability limits.
*   **Crew List:** 4-5 copies, signed and stamped by the Harbor Master at the exit port in Turkey.

### 6.2. The Procedure: Turkey -> Greece
1.  **Exit Turkey:** Visit the Harbor Master and Passport Police at a Turkish Port of Entry (e.g., WIM Customs, Gulluk, Turgutreis) to get exit stamps and close the Turkish Transit Log.
2.  **Enter Greece:** Proceed directly to a Greek **Port of Entry** (Chios, Lesvos, Samos, Kos, Rhodes, Simi). Do not stop at random bays before clearing customs.
3.  **Q-Flag (Yellow):** Upon entering Greek waters, fly the Yellow "Q" Flag (Quarantine) on the starboard spreader until cleared.
4.  **Formalities:**
    *   **Port Police:** Present docs. Issue **DEKPA** (Transit Log).
    *   **Passport Control:** Get entry stamps.
    *   **Customs:** Declare the vessel.

### 6.3. TEPAI (e-Tax)
*   **Requirement:** All vessels >7m in Greek waters must pay the **TEPAI** tax.
*   **Payment:** Best done online (aade.gr) *before* entry to avoid fines.
*   **Penalty:** Failure to pay results in significant fines (approx. €1,000 + owed tax).

### 6.4. Courtesy Flag (Nezaket Bayrağı)
*   Once cleared, lower the Q-Flag and hoist the **Greek Flag** on the starboard spreader.
*   This is not just politeness; it is a maritime requirement in territorial waters.

### 6.5. Returning to Turkey
*   You must complete the "Exit" procedure in Greece (Stamp out passports, close DEKPA) before returning.
*   Entering Turkey without a Greek exit stamp can cause visa issues for future travel.
