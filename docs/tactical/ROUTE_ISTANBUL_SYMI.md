## ⚠️ CRITICAL ALERTS
*   **Meltemi Winds:** In summer, strong N/NW winds funnel through the channel between Datça and Symi.
*   **Ferries:** The "Dodecanese Seaways" catamarans move fast. Give way.
*   **Anchoring:** In Gialos, ensure you drop plenty of chain (40m+) as the bottom drops off quickly, but watch for fouling on other chains.
