## 1. ANCHORING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN (Demirleme)

Unlike the Caribbean or Atlantic, the Med requires specific anchoring techniques due to deep waters and limited swinging room.

### A. The "Meltemi" Protocol
*   **Definition:** Strong, dry N/NW wind in the Aegean (June-September).
*   **Tactics:**
    *   **Scope:** Minimum 5:1 scope (Chain length / Depth). In Meltemi, aim for 7:1 if swinging room allows.
    *   **Snubber (Bosa):** Essential to take the load off the windlass (ırgat). Use a nylon snubber line (8-10m) attached to the chain.
    *   **Backing Down:** Always reverse at 2000 RPM to set the anchor. If it drags, reset immediately.

### B. Stern-to Mooring (Kıçtan Kara)
*   **Standard Practice:** Most harbors (Symi, Datça, Bozburun) require stern-to docking.
*   **The Maneuver:**
    1.  Drop anchor 3-4 boat lengths out from the quay.
    2.  Reverse towards the quay while paying out chain.
    3.  Secure stern lines to the quay.
    4.  Tighten the chain (ensure it's holding the bow off the quay).
*   **Danger:** **Crossed Chains.** Always check where neighbors' chains are pointing.

## 2. CROSS-BORDER LOGIC (TURKEY <-> GREECE)

### A. The "Grey Zones"
*   **Documentation:** Even for a day trip (e.g., Kaş -> Meis), full clearance is legally required.
*   **Flags:** Do not fly the courtesy flag of a country until you have officially cleared customs. Fly the **Yellow Q Flag** until then.
*   **Greek TEPAI:** The e-Tax for cruising in Greece. Must be paid online *before* entering territorial waters to avoid fines (approx €1000).

## 3. ENERGY MANAGEMENT (House Bank)

### A. The 50% Rule (Lead-Acid/AGM)
*   **Fact:** Never discharge lead-acid batteries below 50% capacity. Doing so drastically reduces cycle life.
*   **Voltage Chart (Resting 12V System):**
    *   12.7V = 100%
    *   12.4V = 75%
    *   **12.2V = 50% (CRITICAL THRESHOLD - Start Generator)**
    *   11.9V = Discharged (Damage occuring)

### B. Fridge Economy
*   The fridge is the biggest energy consumer (30-50 Ah/day).
*   **Tip:** Add extra insulation. Keep it full (water bottles act as thermal mass).

## 4. HOLDING TANKS (Black Water)

*   **Turkey (Blue Card / Mavi Kart):**
    *   Discharge into the sea is **strictly prohibited** in many bays (Göcek, Datça).
    *   Pump-out stations must be used.
    *   Digital logging via Blue Card is mandatory.
*   **Strategy:** Plan pump-out stops every 10-14 days. Use shore toilets whenever docked.

## 5. WEATHER PATTERNS

### A. Local Effects
*   **Katabatic Winds:** Cool air falling down mountains at night. Common in mountainous bays (e.g., Fethiye, Göcek). Can hit 25-30 knots unexpectedly.
*   **Cape Effect:** Wind accelerates around headlands (e.g., Knidos, Baba Kale). Expect +10 knots and larger waves.
